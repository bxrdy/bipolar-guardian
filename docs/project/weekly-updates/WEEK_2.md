# Week 2 Progress Summary: Bipolar Guardian

*A summary of the work completed from June 21-28, 2025.*

**Theme for the Week**: Infrastructure Investment & Code Quality

---

## What Was Accomplished

Instead of building new user-facing features, Week 2 became a **comprehensive technical foundation overhaul**. This was a strategic decision to address underlying code quality and security issues that would have slowed down future development. The focus was on investing in a solid infrastructure to enable faster, more reliable development in the weeks to come.

## Key Achievements

### 1. TypeScript Quality Transformation
I conducted a four-phase overhaul of the codebase to improve type safety and maintainability.
- **Decomposition**: Broke down large, monolithic files into smaller, more focused modules.
- **Hook Consolidation**: Merged related React hooks to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Fixed performance issues by optimizing `useMemo` and `useCallback` dependencies.
- **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` types with proper interfaces, resulting in a **30% reduction in linting errors** (from 199 down to 138).

### 2. Security Infrastructure Implementation
I implemented a comprehensive security framework to protect user data.
- **Device Fingerprinting & Session Management**: For enhanced account security.
- **Real-Time Security Monitoring**: A dashboard for threat detection.
- **Data Sanitization**: Ensured that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stripped before being sent to AI models.
- **Database Security**: Closed all identified Row-Level Security (RLS) gaps.

### 3. Architecture Modernization
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Reorganized the code into a more modular, service-oriented architecture.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed over **1,500 lines of dead code** and 17 unused files.

## Development Metrics

- **36 commits** focused on quality and security improvements.
- **143 files modified** across the entire codebase.
- **+19,917 lines added, -2,390 lines removed**, reflecting the significant refactoring effort.

## Strategic Value

This "infrastructure week" was a crucial investment. By resolving technical debt and building a robust security foundation, I've set the stage for the remaining four weeks to be highly productive. The project is now built on a scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture, which will allow for **accelerated, high-quality feature development** moving forward.
