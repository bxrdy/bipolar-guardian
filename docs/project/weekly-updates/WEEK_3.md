# Week 3 Progress Summary: Bipolar Guardian

*A summary of the work completed from June 29 - July 6, 2025.*

**Theme for the Week**: Building the Foundation of Trust

---

## What Was Accomplished

This week was all about making Bipolar Guardian not just smart, but trustworthy. I made a strategic pivot from my original plan to focus on the quality of the AI's insights and the core user experience.

## Key Achievements

### 1. AI Quality & Validation Framework
This was the main event. I built an entire internal system to ensure our AI is accurate and reliable.
- **Testing Panel**: A new developer-only section (`/testing`) was built to monitor and validate the entire AI pipeline.
- **Automated Accuracy Analysis**: I shipped **3 new backend functions** (`analyze-document-accuracy`, `validate-medical-terminology`, `evaluate-therapeutic-response`) to automatically score the quality of our AI's analysis.
- **New Testing Components**: Over **20 new testing components and hooks** were created to support the new validation framework.

### 2. Landing Page Redesign
I redesigned the entire landing page from scratch. The new design is cleaner, more hopeful, and more clearly communicates the app's mission.

### 3. Mobile UI/UX Overhaul
I conducted a deep-dive audit of the mobile experience, fixing dozens of small but important details to make the app feel more responsive, intuitive, and polished.

### 4. Core System Refinements
- **Motion & Design System**: I centralized all animations and design tokens to create a more consistent and professional feel.
- **Community MVP Postponed**: I made the conscious decision to delay the community features to focus on getting the core experience right first.

## Development Metrics

- **80+ commits** focused on the new validation framework and UI/UX overhaul.
- **150+ files modified** across the codebase.

## Strategic Value

This week was about building the bedrock of trust. By focusing on the quality and reliability of the AI, I've laid the groundwork for a system that users can depend on. This foundation will be critical as I move into building more advanced features.
