---

## What Was Accomplished

Week 1 was all about bringing Bipolar Guardian to life. The primary focus was on scaffolding the application, setting up the core technical stack, and implementing the foundational features that will power the user experience.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Initial Project Setup
- **Technology Stack**: The project was initialized with a modern, robust tech stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Framework**: I integrated `shadcn/ui` to provide a library of high-quality, accessible components, which accelerated the UI development process significantly.
- **Supabase Integration**: The backend was set up with Supabase, including the initial database schema and authentication.

### 2. Core Feature Implementation
- **Authentication**: A complete authentication flow was built, including sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Onboarding**: A 3-step user onboarding process was created to personalize the app experience from the start.
- **Dashboard**: The main user dashboard was built, providing a central place for users to view their data and insights.
- **Data Logging**: The initial functionality for logging mood, sleep, activity, and medication was implemented.
- **AI Guardian Chat**: The initial version of the AI Guardian chat interface was built, including the ability to connect to different AI models.

### 3. Early UI/UX Refinements
- A significant amount of time was spent refining the initial UI, fixing layout issues, and ensuring a consistent and polished look and feel across the application.

This foundational work in Week 1 was critical for establishing the project's technical direction and providing a solid base for the more advanced features to come.
