# Accessibility & QA Checklist

**[Documentation Hub](../README.md) > [Developer Documentation](README.md) > Accessibility**

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Standards

### Color Contrast & Visual Design
- [ ] **4.5:1 contrast ratio** for normal text against background
- [ ] **3:1 contrast ratio** for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)
- [ ] **enhanced contrast mode** available via tailwind dark mode
- [ ] color is not the only means of conveying information
- [ ] focus indicators have **2px minimum thickness** with high contrast
- [ ] text remains readable when zoomed to **200%**

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] all interactive elements are **keyboard accessible**
- [ ] **tab order** is logical and predictable
- [ ] **focus traps** work correctly in radix-ui modals and overlays
- [ ] **skip links** are available and functional
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts are **documented and discoverable**
- [ ] **escape key** closes modals and cancels actions

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] **semantic markup** (headings h1-h6) follows proper hierarchy
- [ ] **aria labels** are present for interactive elements
- [ ] **aria live regions** announce dynamic content changes
- [ ] **form labels** are properly associated with react-hook-form inputs
- [ ] **image alt text** is descriptive and meaningful
- [ ] **table headers** are properly marked with scope attributes

### Motion & Animation
- [ ] **reduced motion** is respected when user prefers it (framer-motion)
- [ ] animations do not exceed **3 flashes per second**
- [ ] **auto-playing media** can be paused or stopped
- [ ] motion serves a functional purpose and enhances usability
- [ ] all animations have **reasonable duration** (< 5 seconds)

### Touch & Interaction
- [ ] touch targets are **minimum 44px × 44px**
- [ ] interactive elements have **adequate spacing** (8px minimum)
- [ ] **gesture-based actions** have keyboard alternatives
- [ ] touch interactions provide **haptic feedback** where appropriate (capacitor)
- [ ] **hover states** are accessible on touch devices

## Performance Standards

### Core Web Vitals
- [ ] **largest contentful paint (lcp)** < 2.5 seconds
- [ ] **first input delay (fid)** < 100 milliseconds
- [ ] **cumulative layout shift (cls)** < 0.1
- [ ] **time to interactive (tti)** < 3.8 seconds
- [ ] **total blocking time (tbt)** < 200 milliseconds

### Vite Bundle Optimization
- [ ] **code splitting** implemented for route-based chunks
- [ ] **lazy loading** for non-critical components via react.lazy
- [ ] **tree shaking** removes unused code (vite default)
- [ ] **image optimization** with appropriate formats and sizes
- [ ] **css optimization** via tailwind purging and postcss

### React Runtime Performance
- [ ] **react.memo** used for expensive components
- [ ] **usememo/usecallback** prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] **tanstack query** optimizes data fetching and caching
- [ ] **supabase realtime** minimizes unnecessary network requests
- [ ] **memory leaks** are prevented in useeffect cleanup

## Technical Implementation

### shadcn/ui + Tailwind Design System
- [ ] **design tokens** follow shadcn design system
- [ ] **typography scale** uses tailwind semantic classes (text-xs to text-9xl)
- [ ] **color palette** includes accessible theme colors with dark mode support
- [ ] **spacing system** follows tailwind 4pt grid (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.)
- [ ] **border radius** scale uses tailwind standards (rounded-sm to rounded-3xl)

### Framer Motion Interactions
- [ ] **spring animations** use framer-motion presets and custom configs
- [ ] **easing curves** follow framer-motion standards
- [ ] **duration scale** is consistent across components
- [ ] **micro-interactions** enhance usability without being distracting
- [ ] **page transitions** provide spatial orientation

### Component Quality (Radix UI + shadcn)
- [ ] all components support **disablemotion** prop for accessibility
- [ ] **error boundaries** handle component failures gracefully
- [ ] **loading states** provide feedback for async operations (tanstack query)
- [ ] **empty states** guide users when no content is available
- [ ] **typescript types** are comprehensive and accurate

## Testing Procedures

### Current Testing Setup
- [ ] **axe-core** accessibility tests (needs implementation)
- [ ] **lighthouse** accessibility score targeting 100
- [ ] **eslint** catches accessibility issues in development
- [ ] **typescript** ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors
- [ ] **vite** hot reload for rapid accessibility testing

### Manual Testing (MVP Scope)
- [ ] **keyboard-only navigation** works throughout the app
- [ ] **screen reader testing** with voiceover (macos) or nvda (windows)
- [ ] **voice control** can operate all interactive elements
- [ ] **high contrast mode** maintains usability and readability
- [ ] **zoom to 200%** maintains functionality

### ☐ cross-platform validation
- [ ] **ios safari** - touch interactions and safe area handling (capacitor)
- [ ] **android chrome** - gesture navigation and accessibility services
- [ ] **desktop browsers** - keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [ ] **tablet layouts** - optimal touch targets and responsive design
- [ ] **pwa functionality** - offline capability via capacitor

## success criteria

### accessibility score targets (mvp)
- **lighthouse accessibility**: 95+ (targeting 100)
- **axe-core violations**: 0 (when implemented)
- **color contrast**: wcag aa compliant (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large text)
- **keyboard navigation**: 100% functionality without mouse

### performance score targets (mvp)
- **lighthouse performance**: >85 (targeting >90)
- **lighthouse best practices**: >90
- **core web vitals**: within acceptable thresholds
- **bundle size**: <2mb (targeting <1.5mb when optimized)

### user experience metrics (mvp scope)
- **task completion rate**: >90% for critical user journeys
- **error rate**: <5% for form submissions and data entry
- **accessibility tree depth**: <8 levels for screen reader efficiency
- **focus management**: 100% success rate for radix-ui modal/overlay interactions

## implementation notes

### current mvp status
- **design system**: shadcn/ui + tailwind provides accessible foundation
- **components**: radix-ui primitives include accessibility features by default
- **forms**: react-hook-form with proper labeling
- **navigation**: focus management needs testing and refinement
- **testing**: manual testing prioritized over automated (resource constraints)

### next steps
- implement axe-core testing in development workflow
- conduct comprehensive keyboard navigation audit
- test with actual screen reader users
- document accessibility patterns for component library
- establish accessibility testing pipeline for ci/cd
