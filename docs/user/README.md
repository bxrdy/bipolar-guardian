## Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

BPD stands for **borderline personality disorder**. Bipolar Guardian is primarily focused on supporting individuals with bipolar disorder, but some of its features—such as mood tracking and personalized baseline insights—may also help users who experience BPD symptoms. The application has not been clinically validated and is not intended to replace professional care. Always consult qualified healthcare providers for diagnosis and treatment.
